Vulamobi Backend API
--------------------
For clarity's sake, here is an overview of Vulamobi's present architecture:
![Vulamobi_Architecture_2.0](http://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~swatermeyer/images/Architecture_2.0.jpg)

To call the scripts on the intermediary server hosted on nightmare(people.cs.uct.ac.za/~swatermeyer/Vulamobi) you need to use jQuery AJAX to perform "GET" and "POST" from the client-side native app [demo](http://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~swatermeyer/VulaMobi/).

To save you guys time I have created [vulamobi.js](http://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~swatermeyer/VulaMobi/js/vulamobi.js), this is the client-side javascript file used to perform jQuery AJAX calls to the VulaMobi Backend.

You must [download](http://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~swatermeyer/VulaMobi/js/vulamobi.js) this file aswell as [jquery](http://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~swatermeyer/VulaMobi/js/jquery.js) and include these files in your app then edit **vulamobi.js** as you see fit.
